StripeTaker-1.02
================

This is the open-sourced version of StripeTaker v1.01, a previously-closed source project.

As this project was abandoned in favor of large-scale, MVC-styled projects, this project was edited
so that it could be used by others looking for some kind of solution for Stripe.com integration.

It is not guaranteed to even work (though should) and some portions may need to be edited to make it work or improve on.

Source code released under the MIT License.

This project uses the AES/padCrypt classes from Strategy Star Inc., Zip Module class by PhpConcept, Mobile Detect class by Serban Ghita and Victor Stanciu, the Stripe PHP library from Stripe.com, jQuery 1.8.1, Twitter Bootstrap 2.1.0, and Font Awesome.
